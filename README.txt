SantaClaus is a fun Christmas application powered by Tropo (http://tropo.com) and hosted on Heroku at http://SantaCall.Us.  

SantaClaus allows you to trigger a call from Santa to your loved ones to ask what they would like for Christmas.  Their response is then transcribed and emailed to you for holiday shopping ideas.
